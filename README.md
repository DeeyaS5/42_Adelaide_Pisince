# 42 Piscine (Jan2021)
This repository contains code developed at the 42 Piscine and a summary of my experience, at the 28-day 
gamified intensive peer to peer bootcamp.


## About 42 Adelaide 
     42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
     no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a 
     methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is
     approved in its selection process. The "Piscine", a 28-day C programming bootcamp, 
     is the last stage in the selection process for becoming a student at 42. Once in the school 42 
     conducts learning by developing real projects in teams, based on a gamified curriculum where 
     you earn points that allow you to level up.
    

## Skills developed at the 42 Piscine 
### Tech Skills 👩‍💻
    👉 C language 
        The primary language I learned at the 42 Piscine was C. The concepts we focused on were 
        variables, pointers, addresses, while loops, if conditions, boolean statements, dynamic 
        memory allocation, 2d Arrays, sorting algorithms, function creation and using libraries.
        
    👉 Shell
          The first project and portion of the following exams focused on basic Shell commands to 
          navigate through the terminal
          
    👉 Git 
        All projects were submitted via a remote git repository that was accessed through commands
        such as git add, git commit, git push and git status.
        
    👉 Unix System 💻
        All projects were created on an iMac which utilised the Unix system that allowed multi-
        tasking and easy navigation.
        
### Soft - Skills
    👉 Ability to self-learn and ask questions❓
        At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There 
        are no teachers whatsoever; therefore during the learning process I learnt how to google 
        efficiently and ask meaningful questions to my peers.
        
    👉 Collaboration 👥
         The weekend projects are known as "Rushs": they are 3 or more member groups that are 
         chosen at random by the system. You have to work cohesively with the team by leveraging 
         each members skills in order to fulfill the challenge presented.
          
    👉 Teaching/Communication skills 
        As I had prior coding experience I was able to assit my peers by teaching a series of 
        workshops designed to teach the basics of the C language and provide one-on-one help to 
        those that asked. When helping other students I had to ensure I was communicating the 
        knowledge coherently using examples when possible. My communication skills were also 
        improved by simply interacting with other like-minded students and conveying my 
        thoughts and ideas about the projects.
    
    👉 Time Management ⏰
        42 Adelaide is a 24/7 school open at all times therefore it was crucial to develop my time 
        management skills in order to remain on task and keep progressing on the massive workload.
